//Binary Gap problem efficiently, we need to identify the longest sequence of zeros flanked by ones.

//binary gap 
//Given number N , fuind binary rep of this and then  find max sequence of zeros that is surroundede by 1
//if number 529 = 1000010001 -> 2 gaps - 4 and 3 return 4
//0,5 -> 5-0 = 5-1 = 4 > 0

//1111 => 0, 0000 => 0//edge cases
